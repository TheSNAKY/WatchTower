Download
--------
Add the dependencies to your project:

```groovy
implementation 'com.snakyapps.watchtower:core:1.0.0'
debugImplementation 'com.snakyapps.watchtower:interceptor-okhttp:1.0.0'
releaseImplementation 'com.snakyapps.watchtower:interceptor-okhttp-no-op:1.0.0' // no-op dependency for non-debug build variants
```

Setup
-----
**Add the interceptor to your OKHttp Client**
```kotlin
        val retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()
                        .client(
                            OkHttpClient.Builder()
                            .addInterceptor(WatchTowerInterceptor())
                            .build()
                        )
                        // ...
                .build()

        WatchTower.start(WebWatchTowerObserver(port = 8085)) // in Application class
```

Note: you should call `watchTower.shutDown()` whenever your application/activity is terminating, which shuts down WatchTower-related services.
If you're using it on Android, It's best to start and shut down the WatchTower inside an Android service (using `onCreate` and `onDestroy` of an Android Service)

Features
--------
![Video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adibfara/Watchtower/master/screenshots/video.gif "Watchtower Video")

- Track and observe all API calls made through OKHttp's client
- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH methods
- Query parameters, request and response body and headers
- Response success and failure status, size, date and latency
- Adjustable port for the server and the websocket server
- API call history, even If no browsers were open
- Search in the URLs of all requests
- Fully responsive UI
- Fully extensible


**Observing the events using your browser**
Connect the device that is running the app to the same network that you want to observe the data. If you are on a WiFi, both devices should be connected to the same WiFi so they can communicate with each other.
After running your application, you can navigate to `http://yourip:8085/` and view the network calls. If you don't know what `yourip` is, It will be printed out to the console with the message of `WatchTower started, listening on ... `  when `Watchtower.start()` is called.
