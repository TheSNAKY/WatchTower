Download
--------
Add the dependencies to your project:

```groovy
debugImplementation 'com.snakyapps.watchtower:interceptor-okhttp:2.1.0'
releaseImplementation 'com.snakyapps.watchtower:interceptor-okhttp-no-op:2.1.0' // no-op dependency for non-debug build variants
```

Setup
-----
**Add the interceptor to your OKHttp Client**
```kotlin
        val retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()
                        .client(
                            OkHttpClient.Builder()
                            .addInterceptor(WatchTowerInterceptor())
                            .build()
                        )
                        // ...
                .build()

        WatchTower.start(WebWatchTowerObserver(port = 8085)) // in Application class
```

**(Optional for Android) Add the Android artifact**

![Android Artifact](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adibfara/Watchtower/master/screenshots/android.png "Android Screenshot")

You can add the following artifact to see the requests right in your notification area. You can `collect` from a `Flow<Notification>` and notify the notification manager.

```groovy
debugImplementation 'com.snakyapps.watchtower:android:2.0.3'
releaseImplementation 'com.snakyapps.watchtower:android-no-op:2.0.3' // no-op dependency for non-debug build variants
```

```kotlin
   someScope.launch {
                WatchTowerAndroid.notificationFlow(application, serverPort).collect {
                    notification ->
                    (getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE) as NotificationManager).notify(999991, notification.build())
                }
            }

```

To turn off notifications, you can cancel the coroutine `Job` (e.g. `launch`).

Features
--------
![Video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adibfara/WatchTower/master/screenshots/video.gif "Watchtower Video")

- Track and observe all API calls made through OKHttp's client
- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH methods
- Query parameters, request and response body and headers
- Response success and failure status, size, date and latency
- Adjustable port for the server and the websocket server
- API call history, even If no browsers were open
- Search in the URLs of all requests
- Fully responsive UI
- Fully extensible


**Observing the events using your browser**
Connect the device that is running the app to the same network that you want to observe the data. If you are on a WiFi, both devices should be connected to the same WiFi so they can communicate with each other.
After running your application, you can navigate to `http://yourip:8085/` and view the network calls. If you don't know what `yourip` is, It will be printed out to the console with the message of `WatchTower started, listening on ... `  when `Watchtower.start()` is called.

**Observing emulator events in your computers browser**
If your running WatchTower in an emulator you need to forward both server and websocket ports from the emulator to your local computer. For example if WatchTower is running on port `8085` you would need to run:
```
adb forward tcp:8085 tcp:8085
adb forward tcp:5003 tcp:5003
```
The forward of port 5003 is used for the websocket connection.
